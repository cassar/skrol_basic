        <h3>Welcome to the skrōl beta!</h3>

        <p>
          Beta means the app is still in development and that you should expect
          a few bugs and errors.
        </p>

        <p>
          The aim of the project is to mimic the same process that lead you to
          acquire your first language by presenting you with a stream of
          comprehensible sentences in your target language. This will allow you
          to build up your own model of the language.
        </p>

        <p>
          The idea is that you read the target language sentences as they pass
          through the marquee and use the tools to help you to understand and
          learn. The app will monitor your progress and will choose the best
          sentences for you to see next.
        </p>

        <p>
          The marquee is the only component at the moment, but by using the
          information I collect from your learning sessions (that's right, I'll
          be watching you) I'll be able to recommend other content that you will
          be able to understand and learn from such as audio, video, and books.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this way, It is my hope that I can reduce the time it takes to
          acquire a language from years to months.
        </p>

        <p>Enjoy!</p>

        <h3>Tools</h3>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <strong>Control buttons</strong>, use to speed the marquee up,
            slow it down, and to change languages.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <strong>Hover</strong> over words to see their equivalents
            highlighted in blue in other sentences.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <strong>Click</strong> on individual phonetic characters to hear
            the audio if they turn to green.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <strong>Click and hold</strong> down on the white space below the
            phonetic sentence to reveal the English equivalent.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <strong>Click, hold, and drag</strong> the marquee if you wish to
            bring past sentences back into view.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h3>Warning</h3>
        <p>
          Sentences have been sourced from an external database and have not
          been filtered, apologies if some are rude or cause offence.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I said, expect a few bugs, refreshing the page will fix most of
          them.
        </p>

        <h3>International Phonetic Alphabet</h3>
        <p>
          The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is a, "standardized
          representation of the sounds of spoken language". The
          sentences presented on the middle row of the marquee are all written
          in IPA to help you with pronunciation in your target language.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have tried to source as many sounds as possible from Wikipedia so
          that you can hear a sound when you click on an IPA character but there
          are probably still a few missing.
        </p>

          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet" target="_blank">

        <h3>Contact</h3>
        <p>
          If you have any issues or feedback, just contact me the way you
          usually would.
        </p>

        <p>
          I may consider putting together a Slack channel or Reddit page
          down the track, especially as more 'masters' come onboard.
